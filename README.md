# Green_Skill_Capstone_Project_Unilever

This project, in collaboration with Unilever UK, focuses on integrating digital marketing strategies with sustainable practices in the fast-moving consumer goods sector. Our goal is to equip participants with the skills and knowledge to create impactful, low-environmental-footprint digital marketing campaigns that align with Unilever UK's sustainable living plan.

While partaking in the INCO Green Digital Skills course, I explored carbon emission, its effect on the envioronment and things that i could do to avoid creating further damage in our current race with Global Warming. incorporating sustainable practices ensures that our digital solutions contribute positively to the planet, promoting eco-friendly alternatives and reducing carbon footprints.
